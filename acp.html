          <h2>The Mystery of Cats' Purring!</h2>
          <p>
            Cats purr for various reasons, from contentment to stress.
            Interestingly, cats can also purr when they are injured, and some
            experts believe it may have a healing effect. It has been suggested
            that the frequency of a cat's purring might promote bone density and
            healing, which is an incredible function of this soothing sound.

          <p>
            Cats are independent, but they still love affection! They have been
            domesticated for thousands of years, with the earliest evidence
            showing humans and cats coexisting in ancient Egypt. Unlike dogs,
            cats were likely domesticated by their own choice, attracted by the
            abundance of food around human settlements.
